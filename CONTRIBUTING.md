## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- **Follow PEP 8** for Python code formatting
- **Use meaningful variable names** and function names
- **Add docstrings** to functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** and reasonably sized
- **Use type hints** where appropriate

### Streamlit Best Practices
- **Use caching** (`@st.cache_data`) for expensive operations
- **Handle errors gracefully** with try-catch blocks
- **Provide user feedback** with spinners and status messages
- **Make UI responsive** and mobile-friendly

### Documentation
- **Update README.md** if adding new features
- **Add inline comments** for complex logic
- **Include examples** in docstrings
- **Update requirements.txt** if adding dependencies

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- **Test with real API key** to ensure functionality works
- **Test error handling** with invalid inputs
- **Check responsive design** on different screen sizes
- **Verify all visualizations** render correctly
- **Test export functionality** (CSV, JSON downloads)

### API Testing
- **Use test_api.py** to verify API connectivity
- **Test with different regions** and categories
- **Verify quota usage** is reasonable
- **Handle API rate limits** gracefully
